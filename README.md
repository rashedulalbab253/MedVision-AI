## Overview

MedVision AI is an interactive biomedical computer vision application that analyzes chest X-rays using a deep learning model built with PyTorch.

The application allows users to upload a chest X-ray and receive:

- Pneumonia-class probability
- Interactive Grad-CAM attention visualization
- Adjustable decision threshold
- Model performance metrics
- Downloadable research report
- Session analysis history

This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI workflow from data preprocessing through deployment.
